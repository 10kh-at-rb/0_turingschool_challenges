## Routes and Controllers in Rails

Today we talked about

* the `routes.rb` file in Rails
* the purpose of a controller in Rails
* how to use `resources :things` to create eight RESTful routes

### Your Task

Create a new rails project: `$ rails new routes-controllers-practice`

1) Add this route in your `routes.rb` file: 

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/students', to 'students#index'
end
```

Add a controller and a method within that controller that renders the text: "You've hit the students index page."

2) Modify your routes file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/students', to 'students#index'
  resources :courses
end
```

Add a controller and all methods that the controller will need in order to use the routes generated by this.

3) Modify your routes file:

```ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  get '/students', to 'students#index'
  resources :courses
  resources :teachers
end
```

Can you add something to the end of the `resources :teachers` line in order to only create the `show` and `index` routes instead of all eight routes generated by `resources`? 

Extension:

Can you change `resources :teachers` so that the url relies on the teacher's `last_name` instead of id? Use [this blog post](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rails-patch-change-the-name-of-the-id-parameter-in) for help.
