## Form and Route Helpers in Rails

Clone [this repo](https://github.com/rwarbelow/form_playground), then bundle, run `rake db:migrate`, and open the code in your text editor. 

### Setup

* open the console (`rails c`) and check how many articles already exist. 
* take a look at `seeds.rb` inside of the `db` folder. What is it doing? What would you expect to happen when you run `rake db:seed`? 
* exit the console and run `rake db:seed`
* start up the rails console: `rails c`
* check that you have three articles in the development database

```
> Article.count
   (0.1ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "articles"
 => 3 
```

* exit out of the rails console: `exit`

### Experimenting with Route Helpers

* Start your server with `rails s`.
* Navigate to `localhost:3000/articles`. You should see each of the article titles as a link, in addition to a link for making a new article. 
* In your text editor, open up `app/views/articles/index.html.erb`. Right now, the code to make each individual article link looks like this:

```erb
  <a href="/articles/<%= article.id %>"><%= article.title %></a> <br>
```

* This should look pretty similar to how you created links in TaskManager with Sinatra. 
* Can you replace this bit of code with a Rails route helper that provides the same behavior? Try using [link_to](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/UrlHelper.html#method-i-link_to), and check the Rails Guides for Path and URL Helpers [here](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#path-and-url-helpers). This might also be a good opportunity to practice your Stack Overflow skills in trying to find examples and/or explanations :) 
* Can you replace the "Make a new article" link with another Rails route helper that leads to the form?
* Can you add a link using a route helper on the `show.html.erb` page so that a user can get back to the articles index? 
* How is the prefix section from the output of running `rake routes` connected with route helpers? 

### Form Helpers

* Open `app/views/articles/new.html.erb` and look at the uncommented form helper.
* Navigate to `localhost:3000/articles/new` and use inspect code for the form (for example in Chrome: right-click on the form and choose "inspect element").
* What does `form_for(@article)...` do? What HTML does it generate? Does this look familiar or foreign? What could would you have written to create the same thing in Sinatra? 
* Fill in a title and description in the input boxes. When you click submit on the form, an error should be raised (this is on purpose). That error will show you the params that are coming in:

```
{"utf8"=>"âœ“", "authenticity_token"=>"N1P3tOB7xGlU2GDXKV9tlVwmL2ZXKT3jiumxXNQYmTWl7xdK7X8SrU2z1jBt0/yiUxLkTOwK/r5a1l6+bc+uzg==", "article"=>{"title"=>"title", "body"=>"body"}, "commit"=>"Create Article", "controller"=>"articles", "action"=>"create"}
```

You'll see the keys of `utf8`, `authenticity_token`, `commit`, `controller`, and `action`, but ignore them for now and just focus on the `article` key. 

* How are the params nested? How would you access *just* the article data (title and description) from the `params` hash?
* Go back to `app/views/articles/new.html.erb`. Comment out the first form and uncomment the second form. You'll need to manually take out or put in each `#` in the erb tags. 
* Repeat the steps above. How is `form_tag` different from `form_for`? Either StackOverflow this, look at the docs, or put a `byebug` in the controller and take a look at your params. What is different about the HTML that is generated? (use Chrome inspector to look at the HTML). Are the params nested? What implications might this have for using the params to create a new article? 
* Which do you think makes more sense for creating a new article: `form_for(@article)...` or `form_tag articles_path`? Why?
