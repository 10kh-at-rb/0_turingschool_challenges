## Rails Mini-Project: Putting it all together

### Overview

This week, we talked about

* database schema design
* authentication
* authorization
* pushing logic down the stack
* git workflow

This afternoon, use these new skills to add the following features to your IdeaBox Rails application. You'll work in the same pairs from yesterday. **TDD is not dead.**

#### Categories

* ideas belong to a category
* categories can be created and destroyed by a logged-in admin user (regular logged in users cannot create or destroy categories)
* users can create, edit/update, show, and destroy only their own ideas
* when a user types a new idea into the form, there is a [selection dropdown](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html#option-tags-from-a-collection-of-arbitrary-objects) for choosing the correct category

#### Images

* allow users to add images to their ideas
* an image can have many ideas and an idea can have many images
* images can only be created by an admin user

### Code Review

At 3:30, switch pairs. Spend 15 minutes reviewing each code base. 

* Alexandra Robinson & Laura Whalin
* Scott Crawford & Rich Shea 
* Kit Pearson & Orion Osborn 
* Brandon Mrsny & Krista A Nelson 
* Bhargavi Satpathy & Michael Dao
* Bryce Holcomb & Lydia Shafer
* Jeffrey Wan & Emily Berkeley
* Nathan Owsiany & Chris Luhring

### Homework

Fork the repository so that you and your original pair each have a copy. Finish implementing the category and image features individually using TDD. Add the link to your personal repository to [this document](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions/blob/master/1410/06_mini_project/06_mini_project.yml).
