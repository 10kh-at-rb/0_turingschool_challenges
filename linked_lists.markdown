# Linked Lists

For this challenge, refer to the Linked List information here:
https://github.com/turingschool/data_structures_and_algorithms/tree/master/linked_lists

## Challenge

* Write an implementation of a linked list which can pass all the tests
* Your solution should not use any arrays, hashes, or other collections

## Template

```
class IterativeLinkedList
  # A list using Iterative approaches
end

class RecursiveLinkedList
  # A list using Recursive approaches
end

class Node
  # A single node for either list type
end
```

## Tips

There are two main ways to implement Linked Lists: iteration and recursion. It
would be ideal to solve it each way. You can reuse the same `Node` class for each.

## Constraints

This is a conceptual puzzle more than anything else. Don't spend more than 10
hours on it.
